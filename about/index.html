    <p>I'm GangstaCat. I'm your (not so) local blue loaf cat. I've always been fascinated by how computers work, and I wanted a website without some stupid watermark.
      I've become pretty well at making this stuff, and I like making random programs and making a GitHub repository for them.

      <h3>The story of Loaf</h3>
      <p>In all the time i spent on Discord i made some pretty cool friends, and i was building a collab with FakeMan3113. I also had a server back then, which sadly got nuked a while ago.
        In one of those channels in that server, FakeMan posted an image of a loaf cat with my Geometry Dash icon colors.
        I really liked it, and i set it as my profile photo.
        Later i made some of my own changes to it so it fitted my name better. I added a necklace, sunglasses, and a cigarette (which isn't the healthiest choice but it's a loaf cat).
        I kept that profile photo for most of my online prescence, and i became more known as "Loaf Cat" than "GangstaCat".
        I got the hang of paint.net and started to make some funny images with it.

      <h3>GangstaKitty</h3>
      <p>Not so long ago i got interested in programming, and i decided to make my own discord bot. I always wanted to do this, since i could add any feature i want without having to pay for premium or something like that.
        So i got to learn JavaScript and watched a playlist on how to make a discord bot with discord.js.
        Once i got the hang of that, i went ahead and created 25 commands. some where complicated, and others not so much.
        The command i'm most proud of is the "serverinfo" command, which gets the info about a server and displays it in a fancy embed.
        You can invite the bot in the <a href="/projects/">Coding Projects</a> section.
