    <p><b>I'm GangstaCat. I'm your (not so) local blue loaf cat. But how did i get here?</b> It all started in the middle of the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020,
    when i got bored and remembered i had Discord on my phone. After reviewing my cringe account i left unused for a year i changed my name and profile photo.
    but it wasn't until the beginning of 2021 where the loaf cat power started to set in. At the time i played a lot of Geometry Dash.
    At the time i was casually playing the game, collecting coins and shards and all that stuff. Then when i reached 5 ice shards, i got a cool icon.
    because it was from the ice shards i picked some cool colors that would fit it well. A while later i got the cat icon. I always loved cats, and the fact that i could set it as my icon was really cool.
    So no, i didn't steal my colors from Partition and i don't simp for Juniper.</p>
    <h3>The story of Loaf</h3>
    <p>In all the time i spent on Discord i made some pretty cool friends, and i was building a collab with FakeMan3113. I also had a server back then, which sadly got nuked a while ago.
      In one of those channels in that server, FakeMan posted an image of a loaf cat with my Geometry Dash icon colors.
      I really liked it, and i set it as my profile photo.
      Later i made some of my own changes to it so it fitted my name better. I added a necklace, sunglasses, and a cigarette (which isn't the healthiest choice but it's a loaf cat).
      I kept that profile photo for most of my online prescence, and i became more known as "Loaf Cat" than "GangstaCat".
      I got the hang of paint.net and started to make some funny images with it.

    <h3>GangstaKitty</h3>
    <p>Not so long ago i got interested in programming, and i decided to make my own discord bot. I always wanted to do this, since i could add any feature i want without having to pay for premium or something like that.
      So i got to learn JavaScript and watched a playlist on how to mae a discord bot with discord.js.
      Once i got the hang of that, i went ahead and created 25 commands. some where complicated, and others not so much.
      The command i'm most proud of is the "serverinfo" command, which gets the info about a server and displays it in a fancy embed.
      You can invite the bot in the <a href="projects.html">Coding Projects</a> section.
